/*
To get CSS to ignore the form itself, we use ":not(form)"

To prevent the red outline from showing every time, we use ".ng-touched"
so that it only shows after the value has been "touched".

Rather than using this complex name, we can simply use a custom class, like ".field-error"

.ng-invalid:not(form).ng-touched{
    border: 1px solid red;

.field-error{
    border: 1px solid red;
